# Jeremy Broutin, Swifting

Welcome to my personal blog!  
I'm publishing weekly posts about what I learn on Swift and/or iOS development.  
Writing down my own version of what I learn in a succint format is a way for me to:
- instore a reading habit
- satisfy my curiosity in a structured fashion
- fortify my understanding of key concepts/features/technologies
